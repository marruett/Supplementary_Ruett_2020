This repository contains files that contribute to our supplementary materials of the Manuscript: 'Model-based evaluation of management options in ornamental plant nurseries' by Marius Ruett, Cory Whitney, and Eike Luedeling (2020) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122653). 
Within this repository we provide all necessary files to comprehend procedure of code calculations. We illustrate our code for data visualization that enables reproductivity of our figures. Code chunks can be used or optimized for own illustrations based on ```decisionSupport``` outcomes.

# Model-based evaluation of management options in ornamental plant nurseries 

Decision Analysis in ornamental plant nurseries enables assessment of management options concerning fungal disease regulation. Implementation of management options in ornamental plant nurseries need to be accompanied by maintaining economic viability, determination of systems' uncertainties and factors that influence possible outcome distributions. Results of this approach facilitate decision support for heather producers that seek to implement novel management practices but are exposed to the risky nature of heather production. In addition, recommendations can be made to identify risks before making new decisions.
