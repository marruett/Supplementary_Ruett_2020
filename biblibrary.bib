  abstract = {It is predicted that the world population will reach 9 billion by 2050, of which 70\% will live in urban centres. This change, alongside a changing climate, will strain Earth’s resources, especially the food supply chain. One idea that has been proposed to address this issue is vertical farming – the urban farming of fruits, vegetables, and grains, inside a building in a city or urban centre, in which floors are designed to accommodate certain crops. While an interesting theoretical concept, no studies currently exist that quantify or qualify the validity of such an idea. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to examine the feasibility and plausibility of the vertical farming concept from a socio technical, mixed methods, research perspective. This includes (1) examining how much energy is needed to power such a building and whether renewable energy can meet the onsite demands of the building by constructing a energy model, (2) quantifying the carbon footprint of vertically grown produce and subsequently comparing that to conventionally grown produce, and (3) conducting interviews to explore how relevant stakeholders perceive the concept of vertical farming in order to identify what are current barriers and opportunities exist towards possible uptake of the technology. The findings indicate that vertical farming is a tool that can be used to supply food to cities in a sustainable manner, but this depends on the location and design. Areas of future research are identified.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the emerging need for vertical farms by examining issues related to food security, urban population growth, farmland shortages, “food miles”, and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Urban planners and agricultural leaders have argued that cities will need to produce food internally to respond to demand by increasing population and to avoid paralyzing congestion, harmful pollution, and unaffordable food prices. The paper examines urban agriculture as a solution to these problems by merging food production and consumption in one place, with the vertical farm being suitable for urban areas where available land is limited and expensive. Luckily, recent advances in greenhouse technologies such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics have provided a promising future to the vertical farm concept. These high-tech systems represent a paradigm shift in farming and food production and offer suitable and efficient methods for city farming by minimizing maintenance and maximizing yield. Upon reviewing these technologies and examining project prototypes, we find that these efforts may plant the seeds for the realization of the vertical farm. The paper, however, closes by speculating about the consequences, advantages, and disadvantages of the vertical farm’s implementation. Economic feasibility, codes, regulations, and a lack of expertise remain major obstacles in the path to implementing the vertical farm.},

Nutrient trading for nonpoint sources, including farms, has been suggested as a regulatory tool to improve and protect water quality. However, farmers’ attitudes suggest that they are resistant to adopting the unfamiliar technologies and farm management practices that may be required under such a scheme. This study develops a model of farmers’ resistance to change and demonstrates how this affects their adoption of new mitigation technologies under nutrient trading regulation. We present the model and derive some of its properties in the two-farmer case.},

  abstract = {Maize yield productivity in Ethiopia has been below the genetic potential—constrained, among other factors, by frequent moisture stress due to local weather variability. Changes in climate may exacerbate these limitations to productivity, but current research on projecting responses of maize yields to climate change in Ethiopia is inadequate. The research objectives of this project were to (1) calibrate and evaluate the performance of the APSIM-maize and DSSAT CSM-CERES-Maize models, and (2) assess the impact of climate change on future maize yield. The climate periods considered were near future (2010–2039), middle (2040–2069) and end of the 21st century (2070–2099). Climate simulations were conducted using 20 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Both crop models reasonably reproduced observations for time to anthesis, time to physiological maturity and crop yields, with values for the index of agreement of 0.86, 0.80 and 0.77 for DSSAT, and 0.50, 0.89 and 0.60 for APSIM. Similarly root mean square errors were moderate for days to anthesis (1.3 and 3.7 days, for DSSAT and APSIM, respectively), maturity (4.5 and 3.1 days), and yield (1.1 and 1.2 tons). Deviations of simulated from observed values were low for days to anthesis (DSSAT: −2.4–2.3\%; APSIM: 0–6\%) and days to maturity (DSSAT: −0.6–4.4\%; APSIM: −1.9–3.3\%) but relatively high for yield (DSSAT: −18.5–21.2\%; APSIM: −19.1–37.1\%). Overall the goodness-of-fit measures indicated that models were useful for assessing maize yield at the study site.},

Vertical Farming, which means growing food in skyscrapers, might help to solve many of these problems. The purpose of this study was to construct a Vertical Farm and thereof investigate the economic feasibility of it. In a concurrent Engineering Study initiated by DLR Bremen, a farm, 37 floors high, was designed and simulated in Berlin to estimate the cost of production and market potential of this technology. It yields about 3,500 tons of fruits and vegetables and ca. 140 tons of tilapia fillets, 516 times more than expected from a footprint area of 0.25 ha due to stacking and multiple harvests. The investment costs add up to € 200 million, and it requires 80 million litres of water and 3.5 GWh of power per year. The produced food costs between € 3.50 and € 4.00 per kilogram. In view of its feasibility, we estimate a market for about 50 farms in the short term and almost 3000 farms in the long term. To tap the economic, environmental and social benefits of this technology, extensive research is required to optimise the production process.},

  abstract = {Background: Calluna vulgaris is one of the most important landscaping plants produced in Germany. Its enormous economic success is due to the prolonged flower attractiveness of mutants in flower morphology, the so-called bud-bloomers. In this study, we present the first genetic linkage map of C. vulgaris in which we mapped a locus of the economically highly desired trait “flower type”.
Results: The map was constructed in JoinMap 4.1. using 535 AFLP markers from a single mapping population. A large fraction (40\%) of markers showed distorted segregation. To test the effect of segregation distortion on linkage estimation, these markers were sorted regarding their segregation ratio and added in groups to the data set. The plausibility of group formation was evaluated by comparison of the “two-way pseudo-testcross” and the “integrated” mapping approach. Furthermore, regression mapping was compared to the multipoint-likelihood algorithm. The majority of maps constructed by different combinations of these methods consisted of eight linkage groups corresponding to the chromosome number of C. vulgaris.
Conclusions: All maps confirmed the independent inheritance of the most important horticultural traits “flower type”, “flower colour”, and “leaf colour”. An AFLP marker for the most important breeding target “flower type” was identified. The presented genetic map of C. vulgaris can now serve as a basis for further molecular marker selection and map-based cloning of the candidate gene encoding the unique flower architecture of C. vulgaris bud-bloomers.},

Solutions for improving future food production are exemplified by urban vertical farming which involves much greater use of technology and automation for land-use optimization. The vertical farm strategy aims to significantly increase productivity and reduce the environmental footprint within a framework of urban, indoor, climate-controlled high-rise buildings.

  abstract = {This paper reviews climate change impacts on the production, physiology, yield, and product quality of vegetables affected by shifting CO2 and O3 concentrations, precipitation and temperature conditions, as well as subjected to extreme weather events. The emphasis is on the temperate cool climate of Western Europe. Physiological processes such as respiration and photosynthesis can acclimate to increasing atmospheric CO2 and temperatures. The effect of increased CO2 on vegetables is mostly beneficial for production, but may alter internal product quality, or result in photosynthetic down-regulation. Heat stress reduces fruit set of fruiting vegetables, and speeds up development of determinate vegetables, shortening their time for photoassimilation. In both cases, yield losses result with an impaired product quality, thereby increasing production waste. A longer growing season, arising from warmer temperatures, allows a greater number of plantings to be cultivated, contributing to greater annual yields. However, some vegetables need a period of cold accumulation to produce a harvest. Despite the increasing potential for winter cultivation in the future, perennials like asparagus might increasingly suffer from a lack of winter chilling. In cauliflower, higher temperatures will likely cause insufficient vernalization delaying head induction.},

  abstract = {Unless an anticipation problem is routine and short-term, and objective data are plentiful, expert judgment will be needed. Risk assessment is analogous to anticipating the future, in that models need to be developed and applied to data. Since objective data are often scanty, expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) techniques have been developed for risk assessment that allow models to be developed and parametrized using expert judgment with minimal cognitive and social biases. Here, we conceptualize how EKE can be developed and applied to support anticipation of the future. Accordingly, we begin by defining EKE as a complete process, which involves considering experts as a source of data, and comprises various methods for ensuring the quality of this data, including selecting the best experts, training experts in the normative aspects of anticipation, and combining judgments from several experts, as well as eliciting unbiased estimates and constructs from experts. We detail various aspects of the papers that constitute this special issue and analyse them in terms of the stages of the EKE future-anticipation process that they address. We also identify the remaining gaps in our knowledge. Our conceptualization of EKE with the aim of supporting anticipation of the future is compared and contrasted with the extant research on judgmental forecasting.},

Moreover, stamens are missing. In order to clarify the genetics of this mutation a comparative study of the wild-type and the ‘bud-flowering’ flower type of C. vulgaris was initiated. Scanning electron microscopic analyses of flower organs as well as gene expression studies of an AP3-like and a SEP1-like gene in the different flower whorls of both flower types allowed identification of bracts, sepals and petals. However, loss of stamens in the ‘bud-flowering’ phenotype could not be explained by modified spatial expression of known organ identity genes. Therefore, new approaches (mapbased cloning and differential transcriptome analysis) are now envisioned in order to elucidate the genetics of the ‘bud-flowering’ phenotype.},

  abstract = {Background: Variety protection is of high relevance for the horticultural community and juridical cases have become more frequent in a globalized economy due to essential derivation of varieties. This applies equally to Calluna vulgaris, a vegetatively propagated species from the Ericaceae family that belongs to the top-selling pot plants in Europe. We therefore analyzed the genetic diversity of 74 selected varieties and genotypes of C. vulgaris and 3 of Erica spp. by means of RAPD and iSSR fingerprinting using 168 mono- and polymorphisms. The same data set was utilized to generate a system to reliably identify Essentially Derived Varieties (EDVs) in C. vulgaris, which was adapted from a method suggested for lettuce and barley. This system was developed, validated and used for selected tests of interest in C. vulgaris.
Results: As expected following personal communications with breeders, a very small genetic diversity became evident within C. vulgaris when investigated using our molecular methods. Thus, a dendrogram-based assay to detect Essentially Derived Varieties in this species is not suitable, although varieties are propagated vegetatively. In contrast, the system applied in lettuce, which itself applies pairwise comparisons using appropriate reference sets, proved functional with this species.
Conclusion: The narrow gene pool detected in C. vulgaris may be the genetic basis for juridical conflicts between breeders. We successfully tested a methodology for identification of Essentially Derived Varieties in highly identical C. vulgaris genotypes and recommend this for future proof of essential derivation in C. vulgaris and other vegetatively propagated crops.},

  abstract = {Background: The ornamental crop Calluna vulgaris is of increasing importance to the horticultural industry in the northern hemisphere due to a flower organ mutation: the flowers of the 'bud-flowering' phenotype remain closed i.e. as buds throughout the total flowering period and thereby maintain more colorful flowers for a longer period of time than the wild-type. This feature is accompanied and presumably caused by the complete lack of stamens. Descriptions of this botanical particularity are inconsistent and partially conflicting. In order to clarify basic questions of flower organ identity in general and stamen loss in detail, a study of the wild-type and the 'bud-flowering' flower type of C. vulgaris was initiated.
Results: Flowers were examined by macro- and microscopic techniques. Organ development was investigated comparatively in both the wild-type and the 'bud-flowering' type by histological analyses. Analysis of epidermal cell surface structure of vegetative tissues and perianth organs using scanning electron microscopy revealed that in wild-type flowers the outer whorls of colored organs may be identified as sepals, while the inner ones may be identified as petals. In the 'bud-flowering' type, two whorls of sepals are directly followed by the gynoecium. Both, petals and stamens, are completely missing in this flower type. The uppermost whorl of green leaves represents bracts in both flower types. In addition, two MADS-box genes (homologs of AP3/DEF and SEP1/2) were identified in C. vulgaris using RACE-PCR. Expression analysis by qRT-PCR was conducted for both genes in leaves, bracts, sepals and petals. These experiments revealed an expression pattern supporting the organ classification based on morphological characteristics.
Conclusions: Organ identity in both wild-type and 'bud-flowering' C. vulgaris was clarified using a combination of microscopic and molecular methods. Our results for bract, sepal and petal organ identity are supported by the 'ABCDE model'. However, loss of stamens in the 'bud-flowering' phenotype is an exceptional flower organ modification that cannot be explained by modified spatial expression of known organ identity genes.},

  abstract = {Ecological Footprint Analysis (EFA) is an environmental accounting system that provides an aggregate indicator which is both scientifically robust and easy to understand by non-experts. Although based on the lifestyle consumption of natural resources, recent improvements in the methodology now allow the application of EFA to a final product. Thus the resulting footprint value represents the environmental cost of all of the activities required to create, use and/or dispose of a particular product. The application of EFA to agricultural systems is still uncommon and examples in the fruit sector rare. In this work a detailed application of EFA to a commercial nectarine orchard in Piedmont (Italy) is presented. In contrast to previous studies, we considered not only the one-year field operations, but also the whole lifetime of the orchard. The calculation was conducted for six different orchard stages: (ST1) nursery propagation of the young plants; (ST2) orchard establishment, (ST3) young trees producing low yields, (ST4) mature trees at full production, (ST5) declining trees with low yields, and finally (ST6) orchard removal. The environmental costs at each stage are presented and related to each other on the basis of the relative footprint value. Results highlight the importance of applying EFA to the entire lifecycle of orchard production: ST4 accounted for the majority of costs at 65\% followed by ST2, ST3 and ST5 at or near 10\%, whilst the costs of ST1 and ST6 were negotiable. Thus it is the type of ST4 production used which can have the greatest impact on EFA values.},

Because of the decrease in agricultural lands that will nourish people, the crop losses caused by emerging new pests and diseases, climate change and environmental pollution, the development of alternative agricultural systems in order for the production needed to be made to feed people has become compulsory. Therefore, ‘Vertical Farming Systems’, which is one of the agricultural systems where the yield (harvest) to be received from the unit area is high, is progressing on the way to becoming an agricultural system that will rapidly develop in the future. However, for sustainable production and energy in this system, engineering, architecture, technology and experiences are needed to be used all together. Thus, in this agricultural system with advanced technology, production made in an area of 4000–30 000 m2 is being achieved in an area of 1000 m2; the risk of crop loss dependent on conditions like aridity, floods, pests and disease, etc. is eliminated. By virtue of the utilisation of renewable energy resources (solar, wind, etc.), environmental pollution and fossil fuel consumption decreases. Due to multiplex buildings and systems, it is enabled to carry out agriculture in the city centre and healthy products are provided in the sense of food safety.},

  abstract = {Malta faces a raft of water challenges which are negatively impacting on the sustainability of irrigated agriculture, and creating serious tensions with other sectors competing for water, including urban development, tourism and the environment. In this paper we argue for a transparent process centred on participatory stakeholder engagement to agree on the most challenging water-related risks and to identify solutions that both support the water governance framework and improve on-farm water management practices. Given Malta’s dependence on freshwater, this study focused on outdoor field-scale irrigated production. A three staged stakeholder-driven approach was developed. The first stage included Delphi analyses to identify the key constraints on water management and fuzzy cognitive mapping to enable stakeholders to analyse their mental models and formalise conceptual and causal relationships between different components impacting on Maltese agriculture. Secondly, questionnaires were used to inform understanding of national policy gaps in water management and thirdly, a “backcasting” stakeholder workshop was used to identify policy actions to achieve a more sustainable future for agriculture on the island. The study confirmed that Malta’s core challenge is tied to poor water governance and the need to define policies that are socially and environmentally acceptable and geared to tackling the complex water challenges the agricultural sector faces. Developing support for farmer training, knowledge translation, greater public awareness of the importance and value of water for high-value crop production and multi-sector collaboration to promote shared opportunities for water infrastructure investment were highlighted as potential solutions. The findings have direct relevance to other island communities where water scarcity poses serious agronomic risks to production and where agriculture underpins rural livelihoods and the economy.},

Growers were asked about the importance of sustainability, their views of state environmental regulations, sustainable practices in place and ones they would like to implement in the next 1 to 3 years, and interest in sustainable certification. None of the grower respondents in this survey were certified sustainable, but at least one fourth (25.8\%) were interested in certification. More than half of the respondents currently recycle plastic pots, use controlled-release fertilizers, and composted plant waste. However, only 12\% of growers want to use biodegradable plant containers or implement water conservation measures into their production system within the next 1 to 3 years. Grower respondents felt the biggest obstacle toward implementation was the sustainable production practice would not be compatible with their existing system of production.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on a study examining sustainability in the New Zealand horticulture industry. Despite the growing body of sustainability literature, there remains a lack of prior research focussed on sustainability views, practices, benefits and barriers. The study contributes to the sustainability literature by providing useful insights into views, practices, benefits and barriers in a specific setting e the New Zealand horticulture industry. In particular this paper focuses on grower views of sustainability, the types of sustainability practices adopted, the achievement of benefits from implementing these practices, and the barriers to implementation of additional practices. A mixed methods approach was taken for this study. First an online survey was conducted and then several follow-up interviews were held with survey respondents. The study finds that a number of common views about the term sustainability exist; a broad range of sustainability practices have been implemented by a number of growers; few benefits are expected from growers and even fewer have been achieved; and costs and time are the main barriers to additional implementation. The low survey response rate and resulting small sample means the results may not be generalisable to the entire horticulture industry. This study highlights the need for growers in the New Zealand horticulture industry to be better informed about the adoption process of sustainability practices and the benefits that can be achieved. A number of approaches are possible including the use of education through industry networks and the sharing of best practices.},

  abstract = {Land under organic farming has increased worldwide fourfold since 1999, reaching around 43 million ha in 2014, while organic horticulture farming has doubled during the last decade, representing 1.33 million ha of cultivated organic land. In response to increasing demand for organic products, sales of organic foods have increased fivefold between 1999 and 2014, reaching 80 billion US dollars. In the USA, the biggest organic market (35.9 billion US dollars of retail sales) grew by more than 11\% in 2014 over 2013, while in Europe an increase of 7.6\% was observed with 26.2 billion euros of retail sales. The growing popularity of organic food products is driven by health values and safety issues (e.g., pesticides, hormones, antibiotics, GMOs), environmental benefits and equity concerns. Although the demand for fruits and vegetables is around 30 to 40\% of the global demand, the total area under organic vegetable production is only 0.5\% of the total area of vegetables grown in the world. Forty-five percent of the total vegetable organic farmland is in Europe, followed by North America (22\%), Latin America (18\%) and Asia (12\%). The five countries with the largest organic vegetable areas are the United States (59,669 ha), Mexico (46,573 ha), Poland (26,664 ha), Italy (25,930 ha) and China (22,331 ha). Main crops are fresh beans and peas, leafy and stalked vegetables and fruit vegetables. The world greenhouse industry represents around 473,466 ha, with a 14\% increase over 2015. The total area for organic greenhouse crops is estimated at over 8,302 ha (1.8\% of total vegetable greenhouse area). Europe represents the main producing area with {$>$}5,236 ha (\textasciitilde{}2000 ha Spain; \textasciitilde{}2,000 ha Italy, 500-600 ha France, 263 ha Germany, 125 ha The Netherlands, 80 ha UK, 57 ha Switzerland, 32 ha Belgium, 30 ha Austria, 49 ha Nordic), which is almost entirely used for fruit vegetables and lettuce. In non-EU countries, organic greenhouses cover 500 ha in Israel, 230 ha Morocco, 31 ha in Turkey, 30 ha in Egypt and more than 2,275 ha in North America, mainly located in Mexico. In the USA, organic protected vegetables cover 186 ha (farm sale value of 76.2 million US\$), while in Canada 241 ha of heated greenhouse are organically certified, representing 15\% of the total greenhouse vegetable area. In northern countries, organic protected production is often year-round conducted under high technology and heated greenhouses, while in the Mediterranean area greenhouse production is mainly done in unheated plastic greenhouses or high tunnels. Specific rules for organic greenhouse production were established by several countries such as the organic soilless growing systems in the United States, which is not allowed under EU organic regulation. Recent international reports and scientific literature highlight a number of economic and environmental benefits resulting from organic production systems.},

  abstract = {Global food production faces great challenges in the future. With a future world population of 9.6 billion by 2050, rising urbanization, decreasing arable land, and weather extremes due to climate change, global agriculture is under pressure. While today over 50 \% of the world population live in cities, by 2030, the number will rise to 70 \%. In addition, global emissions have to be kept in mind. Currently, agriculture accounts for around 20–30 \% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Shifting food production to locations with high demands reduces emissions and mitigates climate change. Urban horticulture increases global food production by exploiting new locations for cultivation. However, higher land prices and urban pollution constrain urban horticulture. In this paper, we review different urban cultivation systems throughout the world. Our main findings from ecological, economical, and social aspects are: (1) Urban horticulture activities are increasing globally with at least 100 million people involved worldwide. With potential yields of up to 50 kg per m2 per year and more, vegetable production is the most significant component of urban food production which contributes to global food security. (2) Organoponic and other low-input systems will continue to play an important role for a sustainable and secure food production in the future. (3) Despite the resource efficiency of indoor farming systems, they are still very expensive. (4) Integrating urban horticulture into educational and social programs improves nutrition and food security. Overlaying these, new technologies in horticultural research need to be adopted for urban horticulture to increase future efficiency and productivity. To enhance sustainability, urban horticulture has to be integrated into the urban planning process and supported through policies. However, future food production should not be “local at any price,” but rather committed to increase sustainability.},

  abstract = {Environmental, economic and social aspects of the animal production phase of beef chain have been the focus of individual studies. However, integrated assessments are lacking. Thus, this study aims to develop an approach using sustainable life cycle assessment integrated to multicriteria methods of decisionmaking and probabilistic weighting in order to evaluate the sustainability of four different alternatives of animal production in the southern region of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. By presenting the integrated evaluation in a single score, the system with crop-livestock rotation (CLR) obtained a better performance. The better performance was due to the reduction in mechanization costs for planting and a high capacity of animal support per hectare without directly using phosphate and nitrogen fertilizers. However, by evaluating individual criteria, the pasture fertilization system (PFS) obtained the best performance regarding social indicators due to the high generation of jobs and worker remuneration. Probabilistic weighting in conjunction with the VIKOR (VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) multicriteria method proved to be an efficient solution to exempt human judgment from criteria weighting. This reduces the uncertainty of evaluation and allows a risk analysis considering all possible weight combinations in an integrated and individual way per criterion. However, studies on the development of new indicators related to systems, especially not evaluated criteria such as biodiversity, ecosystem services and animal welfare, are necessary to improve the evaluation of system sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Over-fertilization is a common practice in ornamental nursery production. Oftentimes, visual analysis is used to determine plant nutrient levels, leading to less accurate estimates of fertilizer application. This study focused on exploring the suitability of two non-destructive sensors, Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD-502) and GreenSeekerTM, for measuring plant tissue nutrient uptake. Florikan Top-Dress fertilizer 12N-6P-8K was applied to Justicia brandegeana in various increments (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 g) to simulate plants with deficient to excessive nitrogen rates. Various parameters were recorded including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and SPAD readings, soil leachate analysis (nitrates and phosphate), and total leaf carbon:nitrogen (C:N). The NDVI and SPAD readings were recorded biweekly for three months after the initial controlled release fertilizer (CRF) treatments. Leaf C:N was analyzed through dry combustion while nitrates and phosphate were determined from soil leachate. Results suggest that the smaller amount (20 g) of CRF is as effective in providing N to J. brandegeana as larger amounts (30, 40, 50 g). Implementation of this fertilizer regimen will result in reduced agricultural nutrient runoff and overall negative environmental impacts. Application of optical sensor technology using SPAD and GreenSeekerTM showed promising results in determining the fertilizer requirements of J. brandegeana. This method could serve as a guideline for nursery producers and landscape personnel as a fast and non-destructive tool for sustainable fertilizer management practices within the ornamental plant industry.},

It explores the nature of sustainability-related supply chain risks, distinguishes them from typical supply chain risks and develops an analytical process for their management. An empirical study is conducted to generate insights about how sustainability-related risks should be managed in an integrated way. A mixed method approach is adopted for data collection and analysis. Through an extensive literature review and personal interviews, 30 risks across the three main pillars of sustainability (environmental, social and economic) are identified first. A large survey across different industrial sectors and two exploratory empirical case studies in two textile manufacturing companies are subsequently conducted to assess and analyse several dimensions of sustainability-related risk. The failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) technique is utilised to assess the relative importance of the selected risks, to identify their potential causes and effects and test potential correlations between the identified risks. Based on the findings of the study, risk treatment strategies are proposed for all the identified sustainability-related supply chain risks. The findings show that endogenous environmental risks are perceived to be the most important across different industries and the interconnectedness between several sustainability-related risks is very high. This points to the need for integrated sustainability risk management approaches to facilitate the development of effective sustainable strategies.},

During the 2000s, commercial production of nursery plants of fruits and vegetables was initiated in plant factories. Since the late 2000s, plant factory technology has been introduced worldwide, particularly to Asian countries. Plant factories also provide good cultivation systems for the production of medicinal plants and genetically modified crops for pharmaceutical use. In late 2000s, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were introduced to plant factories as a more efficient light source. LEDs are expected to reduce the electricity costs of lighting and cooling because they have a higher efficiency of converting electric power to light power and exert lower cooling loads than conventional light sources. To achieve plant production in plant factories by using LEDs, more achievement of plant research is required taking engineering and plant physiological approaches, in areas such as the creation of optimal LED lighting systems, promotion of photosynthesis, control of gene expression, photomorphogenesis, and synthesis of secondary metabolites. This study reviews recent research status and achievements regarding plant production in plant factories with artificial lighting and introduces plant research topics related to LEDs utilization.},

We expand our survey of the existing research to the entire production system, including greenhouse structure, energy, electricity, growing media, and fertilizers. Technical and conceptual innovations are discussed, along with structural solutions, such as screenhouses. We believe that this work will contribute to facilitating reductions in direct and indirect emissions from the greenhouse gas inventory while simultaneously reducing the waste from protected cultivation systems. Moreover, we believe that this review will shed new light on some of these approaches and suggest new ways for cleaner production in controlledenvironment systems. The transition to sustainable protected cultivation systems needs to be economically viable e innovative adaptations are required. We recommend adaptations such as maximum insulation, smart climate control, sustainable energy sources such as biogas, photovoltaics and geothermal energy, as well as new concepts for crop production to reduce the impact of protected cultivation on climate change.},

The factors affecting adoption of sustainable practices were evaluated in five areas: environmental regulations, customer value, growers’ attitudes toward sustainability, age, and operation size. A logistic regression model was used to examine factors affecting growers’ adoption of sustainable practices. Nearly two-thirds (65.2\%) of respondents thought sustainability was very important to the environment. Similarly, more than half (63\%) of the respondents had sustainable practices in their operations. Although respondents had positive attitudes toward sustainability and the environment, these positive attitudes alone were unable to predict adoption behaviors. The two most important factors that affected adoption of sustainable practices were the concerns about implementation and the risk perceived by growers. Neither perceived customer value nor the stringency of state regulations affected the adoption of sustainable practices. The results from this study provide original insight into growers’ views of sustainability and identify the educational assistance needed by growers to overcome the factors affecting their adoption of sustainable practices.},

The present paper aims to design a novel decision support system in order to facilitate clean neighbourhood energy planning with the involvement of multiple stakeholders, initiated by a local authority. In our study the cornerstones of a multi-stakeholder decision support system, containing data, models, tools, and a design process are presented so as to assist local authorities in preparing an energy plan for reaching pre-set climate goals. The decision support system was tested in a pilot case in the city of The Hague, The Netherlands. This new policy instrument is helpful for effective energy planning by introducing stakeholders and sharing and learning from different perspectives. The explicit recognition of boundary conditions specified by stakeholders turns out to enrich a purely ‘technical’ energy optimisation plan and to generate a much broader support for new energy initiatives. By making a location-specific plan stakeholders are able to come up with useful information and recommendations. Furthermore, a facilitator present during the design process was necessary to guide the discussion and provide explanations about the data.},

The first is based upon application of Life Cycle Assessment to investigate, at the farm level, the red peach production system in eastern Sicily by using one ha of peach orchard as the functional unit, while the second paper in this series will be focussed upon both environmental improvement assessment and sensitivity analysis. In this context, this paper reports on results from the first phase of the research and, therefore, highlights the inventory and the highest impact processes associated with the analysed system. The topic was addressed because agriculture is responsible for major environmental impacts, which must be reduced. The literature review provided insights into deficiencies in environmental assessments in the fruit production sector, especially within the peach and nectarine sectors. The researchers worked closely with an Eastern Sicilian red peach farmer and had access to in-depth data, which were analysed to identify and quantify hotspots that can be improved to enhance environmental and economic sustainability of red peach production in this region. The researchers documented that the largest impacts were due to irrigation due to large volumes of water and energy used. There are opportunities to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions by improving irrigation practices and in the production and usage of agricultural machinery. Other impacts were found to be due to land transformation, fertiliser and pesticide production and usage.},

There has been relatively little research on the impact of programmes, such as Food for Life, that (a) integrate action on nutrition and food sustainability issues, and (b) are delivered as commissions in a local authority area. The study sought to assess pupil F\&V in schools engaged with the Food for Life (FFL) programme. The design was a cross-sectional study comparing pupils in FFL engaged (n = 24) and non-engaged (n = 23) schools. A total of 2411 pupils aged 8–10 completed a validated self-report questionnaire. After adjusting for confounders, pupils in schools engaged with FFL consumed significantly more servings of F\&V compared to pupils in comparison schools (M = 2.03/1.54, p {$<$} 0.001). Pupils in FFL schools were twice as likely to eat five or more portions of F\&V per day (Odds Ratio = 2.07, p {$<$} 0.001, Confidence Interval = 1.54, 2.77). Total F\&V consumption was significantly higher (p {$<$} 0.05) amongst pupils in schools with a higher level FFL award. Whilst limitations include possible residual confounding, the study suggests primary school engagement with the FFL programme may be an effective way of improving children’s dietary health.},

In order to feed this growing population, there is a need for sustainable urban food. Producing sustainable urban food requires considering all factors of sustainability collectively including, environmental, social and economic advancement. A new method that has been proposed to address the issue of sustainability and to meet the growing food demand is, designing and implementing vertical farms. Vertical farming is a concept that involves cultivating plants with livestock on vertically inclined surfaces such as in skyscrapers in urban areas, where there is a lack of available land and space. However, there is a paucity of information and a limited number of published critical reviews on Vertical farming in urban areas. This study, in an attempt to review the major opportunities and challenges of Vertical Farming, uses the framework of sustainability to examine the role of it in prospective food provision in cities. This study is a critical review of 60 documents from related published papers from relevant journals and scientific online databases. Vertical Farming can be potentially beneficial in increasing food production, maintaining high quality and safety and contributing to sustainable urban farming. Well-known advantages of growing food within the urban territory can be beneficial environmentally, socially and economically. Vertical farms can also provide solutions for increasing food security worldwide.},

  abstract = {Irrigated agriculture is facing rising competition worldwide for access to reliable, low cost, high quality water. In England, farmers are under regulatory pressure to improve irrigation efficiency; indeed, demonstrating efficient water use is now a prerequisite for renewing an irrigation abstraction licence (permit). However, there are differences between the concepts of efficient water use as viewed by scientists, regulators and farmers, further confused by the overlap of similar terminology with both precise technical and wider less specific meanings. Most farmers’ concepts of water efficiency are linked to maximising the farms’ economic productivity rather than saving water per se, except perhaps when their own allocated resources may be inadequate. Using a financial criteria for water efficiency rather than an engineering one appears a sensible approach when assessing irrigation performance at the farm level, since any managerial (e.g. scheduling) and operational (e.g. equipment) inefficiencies associated with irrigation are implicitly included in the assessment. It also allows comparison between individual irrigators (benchmarking) and between different water sectors (e.g. agriculture, leisure, industry). However, estimating the direct financial benefits (value) of water to the farm is only part of the equation; assessing indirect economic benefits, such as the importance of irrigated production to the sustainability of rural communities is equally important, but much harder to achieve. Demonstrating efficient or ‘best’ use of water is not straightforward, but farmers and the water regulator need a rational approach that reflects the needs of the farming community whilst providing a policy framework for protecting the environment. This paper reviews the concept of irrigation efficiency in a temperate climate, considers the farmer perspectives, and supports using the ‘pathway to efficiency’ as a means to assist farmers and the water regulator in achieving better irrigation management and abstraction control.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the reasons why plant factories with artificial light are recently interested in society, requirements for sustainable plant factories, the opportunities and challenges involved in the development of the technology and industry, and types of the plants suitable for plant factories with artificial light. Sustainable plant factories need to be designed and operated for producing high quality plants and transplants with minimum use of resource and minimum emissions of CO2 and environmental pollutants. For this purpose, the concept of “closed system” has been proposed, which is a structure with minimum ventilation, covered with thermally insulated opaque walls, containing multi-tiers (or racks) with artificial light sources. Advantages of this system over the greenhouse include: 1) culture period is shortened by 40-50\% with uniform growth and high quality produce, 2) annual production capacity per floor area is 100-fold, and 3) percent reductions in resource consumption are considerable. For example, percent reduction is 100\% for pesticide and 95\% for irrigation water. Electricity consumption for producing one tomato transplant from a seed is about 300-400 kJ and its cost in Japan is about 1 JPY (0.008 Euro or 1 US cent as of 2011), and is 25 JPY for producing one butter head lettuce from a seed. Methods of developing integrative environmental control and reducing electricity consumption are discussed based mainly on theoretical consideration. Effects of environmental factors on the growth and development are beyond the scope of this paper.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is the activity that contributes most to the emission of greenhouse gases, water quality degradation, soil loss and nutrient runoff worldwide. These harmful environmental impacts are issues in irrigated agriculture in the Brazilian semi-arid region. The rational use of natural resources and the efficiency of agricultural systems can reduce the environmental impacts and are essential for a more sustainable agriculture. However, a limited amount of data concerning the environmental impacts of horticultural practices is available. To date, no evaluation of a carrot crop life cycle in Brazil could be found in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to present a methodological approach combining Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Cleaner Production (CP) principles in the environmental and economic evaluation of irrigated carrot farming. Life Cycle Impact Assessment was carried using the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD, 2011) method, including data uncertainty. We evaluated the base scenario based on management practices widely adopted in the studied area, and the recommended scenario based on adoption of CP selected opportunities using agronomic recommendations for the carrot production system. By these means, the environmental impacts can be reduced between 15 and 70\% in the evaluated categories from the base to the recommended scenario. Most environmental impacts were related to fertilizer production and field emissions. The global warming effect related to the emission of 0.12 kg CO2 eq/kg product from the base scenario can be reduced to 0.07 kg CO2 eq/kg product in the recommended scenario. This represents a lower value than most global warming rates for carrots found in literature. The costs of inputs were reduced by 49\% from in the recommended scenario. Most costs of inputs were related to fertilizers and seed purchasing. The combined use of the two methods proved feasible as LCA identifies the main hotspots of the analyzed system, while CP support practices that reduce costs and the use of inputs such as water, energy, fertilizers, seeds and pesticides. CP provided a higher level of compliance with the technical requirements for the studied system and proved to be more economically and environmentally efficient than ‘end of pipe’ practices. The complementary use of CP and LCA provided better support for a more sustainable irrigated carrot production in the semiarid region of Brazil.},

  abstract = {Sustainability has arisen as an alternative to the dominant socio-economic paradigm (DSP). However, it is still a difficult concept for many to fully understand. To help to communicate it and make it more tangible visual representations have been used. Three of the most used, and critiqued, sustainability representations are: (1) a Venn diagram, i.e. three circles that inter-connect, where the resulting overlap that represents sustainability can be misleading; (2) three concentric circles, the inner circle representing economic aspects, the middle social aspects, and the outer environmental aspects; and (3) the Planning Hexagon, showing the relationships among economy, environment, the individual, group norms, technical skills, and legal and planning systems. Each has been useful in helping to engage the general public and raising sustainability awareness. However, they all suffer from being highly anthropocentric, compartmentalised, and lacking completeness and continuity. These drawbacks have reduced their acceptance and use by more advanced sustainability scholars, researchers and practitioners. This paper presents an innovative attempt to represent sustainability in three dimensions which show the complex and dynamic equilibria among economic, environmental and social aspects, and the short-, long- and longer-term perspectives.},

  abstract = {Decision-making in development rarely considers uncertainty in project benefits and costs and the risk of project failure. Lack of appropriate tools for ex-ante analysis under conditions of data scarcity constrains the ability of decision-makers to anticipate project outcomes. Business analysis techniques can help in such situations, but they have rarely been applied in development contexts. We use the principles of Applied Information Economics to develop a decision model for a water supply intervention. In the proposed Habaswein-Wajir Water Supply Project in Northern Kenya, water is to be extracted from a major aquifer near Habaswein and piped to the city of Wajir. A team of eight experts developed a model including all costs, benefits, and risks considered important for project success. After estimation training, these experts expressed their uncertainty for about 100 variables in the model with probability distributions. We used Monte Carlo simulation to project decision outcomes, and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to identify critical uncertainties affecting the decision. The project was found to be risky for most stakeholders, mainly due to the risk of political interference caused by water supply concerns in Habaswein and due to unclear profitability of the water supply business. Uncertainties about how to value decreasing infant mortality and reduction in water-borne disease incidence were also critical. The greatest hydrological risk was salt water intrusion into the aquifer. Careful well design, inclusive project planning and benefit sharing could raise the chance of project success. The analysis improved understanding of the decision by all stakeholders, some of which changed their opinions on the pipeline, requested more measurements, or proposed alternative water supply options. Decision analysis can help clarify decision uncertainties and outcome expectations and thereby improve decision-making processes, especially in data-scarce areas.},

Applying rigorous expert judgment is an important dimension of assessment. Here we evaluate advances and challenges in approaches to expert judgment in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5). We find that revised guidance for author teams improved the development of balanced judgments on scientific evidence across disciplines. In particular, expert judgments underpinning conclusions are more extensively, transparently, and consistently communicated: degree-of-certainty terms are more abundant in AR5 policymaker summaries; wider ranges of possible outcomes are presented with greater inclusion of lower-certainty, decision-relevant findings; and expert judgments supporting conclusions are more comparable across working groups. But challenges in developing and communicating assessment conclusions persist, especially for findings with substantial uncertainties and for subjective aspects of judgments. Based on our evaluations and AR5 lessons learned, we propose a simpler, more rigorous framework for developing and communicating expert judgments in environmental assessment. We also describe practices for reducing expert-judgment biases, for advancing integration of evidence and expert judgment, and for addressing subjective dimensions of expert opinion directly and proactively.},

Ecological models are increasingly being looked to as a means of assisting the decisionmaking process, but very often the data are missing or are unsuited to empirical modelling. This paper describes the development and application of the Delphi approach to develop a decision support tool for wildlife conservation and management. The Delphi process is an expert-based approach to decision support that can be used as a means for predicting outcomes in situations where ‘absolute’ or ‘objective’ models are unavailable or compromised by lack of appropriate data. The method aims to develop consensus between experts over several rounds of deliberation on the assumption that combining the expertise of several individuals will provide more reliable results than consulting one or two individuals. In this paper the approach is used to engineer soft knowledge on the conservation requirements of capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, an endangered woodland grouse, into a model that can be used by forests managers to improve the quality of forest habitat for capercaillie over extensive commercial forest areas. This paper concludes with a discussion of the potential advantages and disadvantages of Delphi and other soft knowledge approaches to ecological modelling and conservation management.},

Our field analysis of these sites, confirmed by generic estimates, shows very low food outputs relative to the populations of their catchment areas; the great share of urban food will continue to come from multiple foodsheds beyond urban peripheries, often far beyond. Cultivation is a more appropriate designation than agriculture for urban food growing because its sustainability benefits are more social than agronomic or ecological. A major potential benefit lies in enhancing the ecological knowledge of urbanites, including an appreciation of the role that organic food may play in promoting both sustainability and health. This study illustrates how benefits differ according to local conditions, including population density and demographics, operational scale, soil quality, and access to labor and consumers. Recognizing the real benefits, including the promotion of sustainable diets, could enable urban food growing to be developed as a component of regional foodsheds to improve the sustainability and resilience of food supply, and to further the process of public co-production of new forms of urban conviviality and wellbeing.},

  abstract = {Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have tremendous potential as supplemental or sole-source lighting systems for crop production both on and off earth. Their small size, durability, long operating lifetime, wavelength specificity, relatively cool emitting surfaces, and linear photon output with electrical input current make these solid-state light sources ideal for use in plant lighting designs. Because the output waveband of LEDs (single color, nonphosphor-coated) is much narrower than that of traditional sources of electric lighting used for plant growth, one challenge in designing an optimum plant lighting system is to determine wavelengths essential for specific crops. Work at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center has focused on the proportion of blue light required for normal plant growth as well as the optimum wavelength of red and the red/far-red ratio. The addition of green wavelengths for improved plant growth as well as for visual monitoring of plant status has been addressed. Like with other light sources, spectral quality of LEDs can have dramatic effects on crop anatomy and morphology as well as nutrient uptake and pathogen development. Work at Purdue University has focused on geometry of light delivery to improve energy use efficiency of a crop lighting system. Additionally, foliar intumescence developing in the absence of ultraviolet light or other less understood stimuli could become a serious limitation for some crops lighted solely by narrow-band LEDs. Ways to prevent this condition are being investigated. Potential LED benefits to the controlled environment agriculture industry are numerous and more work needs to be done to position horticulture at the forefront of this promising technology.},

Inoculum sources of the pathogen included diseased stock plants, crop debris, nursery soils, used growing media, pots and floor covering, and dust collected from greenhouse walkways. Isolates were not host-specific and infected other species of ericaceous plants, with typical symptoms including browning of foliage, stems and roots, and the presence of black or greenish black acervuli on diseased tissue. The optimum temperature for growth of three selected isolates of the pathogen was 20–25 ◦C, with little or no growth occurring below 5 or above 30 ◦C. Growth occurred over pH 2.6–8.6, with optimum at 5.5. Decreases in matric potential from −0.3 to −4.0 MPa reduced growth, which was totally inhibited at −6.5 MPa. Greenhouse trials were conducted to evaluate the effects of disease management methods (irrigation, flooring/pot disinfection and fungicide application) on control of the pathogen on potted plants of C vulgaris. Disease incidence and foliar browning caused by P sydowiana were less on fungicide-treated (five-spray programme of alternating prochloraz and carbendazim) potted plants watered by sub-irrigation compared with watering from overhead. Single and combined treatments of flooring/pot disinfection (hydrogen peroxide/peracetic acid) and the five-spray fungicide programme significantly reduced disease incidence and severity compared with dipping pots in water. The combined disinfection and fungicide programme significantly reduced disease incidence and severity, compared to disinfection or fungicide application alone. The importance of these findings for the integrated control of P sydowiana on ericaceous plant nurseries is discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Grey mould (Botrytis cinerea Pers. ex Fr.) is a damaging disease affecting container-grown Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull. Trials were conducted to test anilinopyrimidine fungicides (pyrimethanil, cyprodinil and mepanipyrim), azoxystrobin and tolylfluanid for crop safety on cultivars, and to evaluate spray programmes based on alternating these fungicides with different modes of action for disease control. Timing and application at different spray intervals were also investigated.
RESULTS: Cyprodinil was slightly phytotoxic on only one of the seven cvs tested. Alternating nine-spray programmes of azoxystrobin with an anilinopyrimidine or tolylfluanid, or an anilinopyrimidine with tolylfluanid, with the first spray applied immediately after potting, were equally effective in reducing disease incidence and severity compared with untreated plants. Spray programmes of five or eight sprays, using an anilinopyrimidine and at least one other fungicide with a different mode of action, applied alternately or in blocks of two sprays of the same fungicide and immediately after potting, were equally effective in reducing disease. Omission of early fungicide sprays until 9 weeks after potting and subsequent alternate application of pyrimethanil and tolylfluanid with a different mode of action at 6 week intervals gave reduced disease control.
CONCLUSION: There is potential to use spray programmes based on alternating anilinopyrimidines with fungicides with a different mode of action to provide effective control of B. cinerea on C. vulgaris.  2008 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Productivity of crops grown for human consumption is at risk due to the incidence of pests, especially weeds, pathogens and animal pests. Crop losses due to these harmful organisms can be substantial and may be prevented, or reduced, by crop protection measures. An overview is given on different types of crop losses as well as on various methods of pest control developed during the last century. Estimates on potential and actual losses despite the current crop protection practices are given for wheat, rice, maize, potatoes, soybeans, and cotton for the period 2001–03 on a regional basis (19 regions) as well as for the global total. Among crops, the total global potential loss due to pests varied from about 50 \% in wheat to more than 80 \% in cotton production. The responses are estimated as losses of 26–29 \% for soybean, wheat and cotton, and 31, 37 and 40 \% for maize, rice and potatoes, respectively. Overall, weeds produced the highest potential loss (34 \%), with animal pests and pathogens being less important (losses of 18 and 16 \%). The efficacy of crop protection was higher in cash crops than in food crops. Weed control can be managed mechanically or chemically, therefore worldwide efficacy was considerably higher than for the control of animal pests or diseases, which rely heavily on synthetic chemicals. Regional differences in efficacy are outlined. Despite a clear increase in pesticide use, crop losses have not significantly decreased during the last 40 years. However, pesticide use has enabled farmers to modify production systems and to increase crop productivity without sustaining the higher losses likely to occur from an increased susceptibility to the damaging effect of pests.},

  abstract = {Sustainable agriculture seeks to at least use nature as the model for designing agricultural systems. Since nature integrates her plants and animals into diverse landscape, a major tenet of sustainable agriculture is efficiency and lack of waste products in nature. When domestication of crops replaced hunting and gathering of food, landscape changed accordingly. By producing a limited selection of crop plants and animals, human kind has substantially reduced the level of biological diversity over much of the earth. There is more cooperation in nature than competition. Cooperation is exemplified by mutually beneficial relationships that occur between species within communities. If left undistributed and unplanted an abandoned crop field will first be colonized by just a few species of organisms but after several years a complex community made up of many wild species develops. Stability is reached by a community when it has reached a high level of diversity. Diverse communities have fewer fluctuations in numbers of a given species and are stable. The practices which promote diversity and stability on the farm are enterprise diversification, crop rotation, use of wind breaks, provision of more habitats for microorganisms, intercropping and integration of crop farming with livestock production. Intercropping is the cultivation of two or more crops at the same time in the same field. Its advantages are risk minimization, increased income and food security, reduction of soil erosion and pest and disease control. This paper discusses the practice of intercropping in horticultural crop production to promote sustainability. Many crop systems are discussed.},

  abstract = {International investment in fruit and vegetable research is very low despite the strategic importance of these species in our lives. Fruits, vegetables and nuts are gaining increasing attention in the nutrition community for their role in combating the triple burden of malnutrition. These major horticultural groups are characterized by remarkable levels of genetic diversity in both wild and cultivated species, yet much of their diversity is underutilized and poorly conserved. The genetic and nutritional richness of fruit and vegetables is equalled by a unique diversity of traditional knowledge associated with their management and use. This paper will share the work of Bioversity International and its partners in blending good practices developed by farmers with scientific approaches for the sustainable conservation and utilisation of underutilised horticultural species across Latin America and South East Asia. We will highlight methods, approaches and tools that have helped local communities to strengthen the conservation of wild and cultivated species, to add value and improve the marketing of horticultural products, and to enhance their contribution to improving food and nutrition security. Findings from our work show that empowering farmers and their institutions, actively engaging them in research for development activities while creating space for social learning and innovation, as well as gendersensitive interventions, can contribute to a dynamic system of community biodiversity management and sustainable use. An additional focus of Bioversity International’s recent work has been examining ways to diversify school meals and public food procurement programmes through the better integration of local fruit and vegetables. While such an approach has much potential to contribute to healthier diets and improved nutrition, it can also be linked to agricultural and community development by improving farmer livelihoods and environmental sustainability.},

The determining factors, identified through a systematic review of the available literature, are thematically synthesized, conceptually framed and utilized for the development of a case study. The single case study approach is utilized to develop a detailed and nuanced understanding of the context, evaluating the practices of 4 cooperative primary producers operating within a forward integrated supply chain. The study posits that the combination of climatic and biophysical dynamism inherent in the primary producer environment, in combination with the inflexibility of seasonal batch production, imposes itself as a key barrier to the imposition of pull and flow in the chain, the fundamental tenets of a lean system. A case is outlined where cold infrastructure is employed to break the inflexibility of supply whilst a process of forward contracting establishes fruit orders up to 1-year in advance, beyond the forthcoming annual cultivation cycle, functionally transforming the system of cultivation from a “push” to a “pull” system of production. It is further highlighted that functional partitioning of the organizational-chain structure is necessary to isolate and mitigate the effects of contextual dynamism, whereby downstream chain structures purposed for agility and responsiveness serve as a protective buffer to lean focused grower operations. The findings reaffirm the positive relationship between the size of the grower operation, the capacitation of the workforce and the ability of the operation to attain superior performance outcomes. However, it is severally highlighted that horizontal cooperation between primary producers may help overcome the resource limitations of smaller growers. Data based decision controls are marked as being a centrally important sustainable performance determinant, both at the level of the grower, in terms of orchard management and harvest process control, as well as at the level of the cooperative serving the needs of crop programming and practice benchmarking processes. This exposition of determining factors driving lean sustainable performance in horticultural primary production represents a new contribution to the body of literature linking lean and sustainable organizational performance. The study should support further development of lean management research and operationalized lean methods within the fruit horticulture subsector as well as the broader agri-food context.},

  abstract = {There are several biases and inefficiencies that are commonly associated with the judgmental extrapolation of time series, even when the forecasters have technical knowledge about forecasting. This study examines the effectiveness of using a rolling training approach, based on feedback, to improve the accuracy of forecasts elicited from people with such knowledge. In an experiment, forecasters were asked to make multiple judgmental extrapolations for a set of time series from different time origins. For each series in turn, the participants were either unaided or provided with feedback. In the latter case, the true outcomes and performance feedback were provided following the submission of each set of forecasts. The objective was to provide a training scheme that would enable forecasters to understand the underlying pattern of the data better by learning from their forecast errors directly. An analysis of the results indicated that this rolling training approach is an effective method for enhancing the judgmental extrapolations elicited from people with technical knowledge, especially when bias feedback is provided. As such, it could be a valuable element in the design of software systems that are intended to support expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) in forecasting.},

Preventive applications of anilinopyrimidines completely protected young cucumber plants and fruits that were inoculated with all strains of B. cinerea. The effectiveness of pyrimethanil against grey mould was studied in greenhouse grown tomatoes in relation to (a) the type of infection and the progress of the disease on different plant parts and (b) the response of the naturally occurring B. cinerea population to the selection pressure caused by eight successive applications of this fungicide. Pyrimethanil effectively controlled grey mould on leaves, fruits and stems but did not significantly reduce the number of dead plants and fruits with ‘ghost spot’ symptoms. The selection pressure caused by the consecutive applications of pyrimethanil resulted in reduction of its effectiveness on leaves that became apparent after the sixth application. This was correlated with a shift of the B. cinerea population (not previously exposed to anilinopyrimidines) towards reduced sensitivity, probably due to the development of a low level of resistance (RL = 7.7). Pyrimethanil delayed the onset of the disease but it did not reduce the infection rate.},

In this paper we consider how the existing agricultural innovation systems (AIS) approach might be opened up to better support the creation of innovation niches. We engage with Innovation Ecosystems thinking to consider the ways in which it might enhance efforts to create multi-actor, cross-sectoral innovation niches that are capable of supporting transitions to sustainable agricultural systems across multiple scales. While sharing many similarities with AIS thinking, Innovation Ecosystems thinking has the potential to broaden AIS by: emphasizing the role of power in shaping directionality in innovation platforms or innovation communities that are connected to niches and their interaction with regimes; highlighting the plurality of actors and actants and the integral role of ecological actants in innovation; and offering an umbrella concept through which to cross scalar and paradigmatic or sector boundaries in order to engage with a variety of innovation systems affecting multifunctional agricultural landscapes and systems. To this end, an Agricultural Innovation Ecosystems approach may help design and support development of transboundary, inter-sectoral innovation niches that can realize more collective and integrated innovation in support of sustainability transitions, and help enact mission oriented agricultural innovation policy.},

These treatments consisted of the application of four nutrient solutions with different electrical conductivity (ECw) levels ranging from 1.5 dS m−1 (control treatment) to 4.5 dS m−1. The results showed that day-time transpiration decreases when salt concentration in the nutrient solution increases. The transpiration of the plant in the control treatment was modelled by applying a combination method while the effect of the salinity of the nutrient solution was modelled by deriving a saline stress coefficient from the experimental data. The results showed that significant reductions in plant transpiration were observed for increasing values of ECw. The crop development and yield were also affected by the increasing salinity of the nutrient solution. A relationship between the ECw and the relative crop yield was derived.},

Hence, a breeding program for polyploids was set up in order to broaden phenotypic variation in this important ornamental crop. Therefor basic genetic characteristics of polyploid C. vulgaris were analyzed using the progeny of a spontaneously occurring tetraploid genotype. With the help of morphological and molecular marker analysis, it was determined that the autotetraploid plant probably arose from unreduced gametes resulting from first division restitution. Tetraploids displayed tetrasomic inheritance with free combination of homologous and homeologous chromosomes. Triploids were semifertile with a high rate of aneuploids in their progeny. As the so-called bud-blooming flower type is a trait of outstanding interest in breeding of C. vulgaris, a strategy for efficient breeding of triploid bud-bloomers was deduced.},

  abstract = {Farmers have been increasingly called upon to respond to an ongoing redefinition in consumers' demands, having as a converging theme the search for sustainable production practices. In order to satisfy this objective, instruments for the environmental management of agricultural activities have been sought out. Environmental impact assessment methods are appropriate tools to address the choice of technologies and management practices to minimize negative effects of agricultural development, while maximizing productive efficiency, sound usage of natural resources, conservation of ecological assets and equitable access to wealth generation means. The ‘system for weighted environmental impact assessment of rural activities’ (APOIA-NovoRural) presented in this paper is organized to provide integrated farm sustainability assessment according to quantitative environmental standards and defined socio-economic benchmarks. The system integrates sixty-two objective indicators in five sustainability dimensions — (i) Landscape ecology, (ii) Environmental quality (atmosphere, water and soil), (iii) Sociocultural values, (iv) Economic values, and (v) Management and administration. Impact indices are expressed in three integration levels: (i) specific indicators, that offer a diagnostic and managerial tool for farmers and rural administrators, by pointing out particular attributes of the rural activities that may be failing to comply with defined environmental performance objectives; (ii) integrated sustainability dimensions, that show decision-makers the major contributions of the rural activities toward local sustainable development, facilitating the definition of control actions and promotion measures; and (iii) aggregated sustainability index, that can be considered a yardstick for eco-certification purposes. Nine fully documented case studies carried out with the APOIANovoRural system, focusing on different scales, diverse rural activities/farming systems, and contrasting spatial/territorial contexts, attest to the malleability of the method and its applicability as an integrated farm environmental management tool.},

  abstract = {Development programs have typically neglected uncertainty and variability in terms of outcomes and socio-ecological context when promoting conservation agriculture (CA) throughout sub-Saharan Africa. We developed a simple Monte Carlo-based decision model, calibrated to global data-sets and parameterized to local conditions, to predict the range of yield benefits farmers may obtain when adopting CA in two ongoing agricultural development projects in East Africa. Our general model predicts the yield effects of adopting CA-related practices average −0.60 ± 2.05 (sd) Mg maize ha−1 year−1, indicating a near equal chance of positive and negative impacts on yield. When using site-specific, socio-economic, and biophysical data, mean changes in yield were more negative (−1.29 and −1.34 Mg ha−1 year−1). Moreover, practically the entire distributions of potential yield impacts were negative suggesting CA is highly unlikely to generate yield benefits for farmers in the two locations. Despite comparable aggregate effects at both sites, factors such as land tenure, access to information, and livestock pressure contrast sharply highlighting the need to quantify the range of livelihood and landscape effects when evaluating the suitability of the technology. This analysis illustrates the potential of incorporating uncertainty in rapid assessments of agricultural development interventions. Whereas this study examines project-level decisions on one specific intervention, the approach is equally relevant to address decision-making for multiple interventions, at multiple scales, and for multiple criteria (e.g., across ecosystem services), and thus is an important tool that can support linking knowledge with action.},

This study presents a comprehensive environmental assessment of food production in an integrated rooftop greenhouse (i-RTG) – an innovative vertical farm consisting of a rooftop greenhouse connected to a building – and considers rainwater, residual heat (energy), residual air (CO2) and food from an industrial ecology perspective. This synergistic connection preserves resources and improves conditions in the greenhouse and the building. The goal of the study is to show the feasibility of the system and to calculate the environmental impacts from its whole life cycle, from infrastructure to end of life, by comparing these impacts with those of conventional production. The results show that the system is feasible and produced 30.2 kg/m2 of tomato over 15.5 months. The synergy with the building allows the cultivation of winter-fall crops without supplying heating and maintained an average temperature 8 °C higher than that outdoors. Moreover, rainwater was used to irrigate the crops, reducing consumption from the water supply network by 80-90\%. The environmental assessment showed that the operation of the i-RTG has more impacts than the infrastructure (structure of the greenhouse, rainwater harvesting system and equipment) due to the use of fertilisers, which account for 25\% of the impacts in four of the six impact categories studied. Regarding the infrastructure, the greenhouse structure and rainwater harvesting system of the building have substantial environmental impacts (over 30\% in four of the six impact categories). Comparison with a conventional greenhouse demonstrates that the i-RTG has a better environmental performance, showing between 50 and 75\% lower impacts in five of the six impact categories (for instance, 0.58 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg of tomato vs. 1.7 kg), mainly due to the reduced packaging and transport requirements. From this study, it was concluded that optimisation of the amount of infrastructure material and management of the operation could lead to even better environmental performance in future i-RTG projects.},

This paper addresses these shortcomings by analyzing the intersection between producer and consumer attitudes toward environmental sustainability with their actual practices, drawing data from focus group interviews and surveys with producers and consumers in Washington State, USA. We compare farmers’ attitudes toward several agricultural and environmental policies with their self-reported practices to examine whether support for environmental policies aligns with sustainable farming practices. For consumers, we investigate the relationship between their attitudes toward the same agricultural and environmental policy issues with their interest in purchasing food produced in an environmentally sustainable manner. Through our analyses, we find that consumers’ and producers’ practices are not always consistently correlated with their environmental attitudes, but that support for agricultural land preservation is one policy area in which the interests of producers and consumers intersect with their interest in sustainable farming and food. Findings from our individual and focus group interviews assist us in understanding the multiple, sometimes competing, factors that consumers and producers must weigh in making decisions about environmentally sustainable food and farming.},

  abstract = {The rising population and reduction in the amount of land and some other resources have created tremendous pressure on current agricultural producers to meet the increasing food demands. To cope with this challenge, certain key inputs, such as fertilizers and other chemicals, are overused, which are worsening the surroundings. This intensive agricultural production without adherence to ecological sustainability has led to declining soil health, land degradation, and severe environmental problems. So, future efforts to feed the growing population should aim for greater agricultural production within sustainable environments. In this regard, innovative steps are needed, as business-as-usual policies lack the potential to cope with these challenges. The concept of agricultural sustainability and various soil and crop management strategies (SCMS) that have been designed to optimize crop yield under sustainable environmental conditions are discussed, including nutrient management, site specific nutrient management (SSNM), integrated nutrient management (INM), integrated soil fertility management (ISFM), integrated soil-crop system management (ISSM), ridge-furrow mulching systems (RFMS), sustainable water management (SWM), conservation agriculture (CA), sustainable land management (SLM), vertical/sky farming, and integrated crop management, and breeding strategies as well as other approaches combined with technological and behavioural changes. The present review suggests that a sustainable production system can be developed by combining the multifaceted efforts under SCMS practices with short- and long-term preventive measures. Reducing chemicals’ usage, such as that of fertilizers and pesticides, plus improvements in the crop input use efficiency could minimize greenhouse gases emissions while protecting the environment. Sustainable agriculture holds promise for humankind and the planet Earth, and it can be successful if all developed and developing nations stand together to seek ‘our common future’ to produce more food while generating less environmental pressure.},

  abstract = {The concept of vertical farming is nearly twenty years old, however, there are only a few experimental prototypes despite its many advantages compared to conventional agriculture. Significantly, financial uncertainty has been identified as the largest barrier to the realization of a ‘real’ vertical farm. Some specialists have provided ways to calculate costs and return on investment, however, most of them are superficial with calculations based on particular contextual circumstances. To move the concept forwards a reliable and flexible estimating tool, specific to this new building typology, is clearly required. A computational system, software named VFer, has therefore been developed by the authors to provide such a solution. This paper examines this highly flexible, customised system and results from several typical vertical farm configurations in three mega-cities (Shanghai, London and Washington DC) are used to elucidate the potential economic return of vertical farms.},

  abstract = {Background: Low fruit and vegetable (FV) intake is a leading risk factor for chronic disease globally, but much of the world’s population does not consume the recommended servings of FV daily. It remains unknown whether global supply of FV is sufficient to meet current and growing population needs. We sought to determine whether supply of FV is sufficient to meet current and growing population needs, globally and in individual countries.
Methods and Findings: We used global data on agricultural production and population size to compare supply of FV in 2009 with population need, globally and in individual countries. We found that the global supply of FV falls, on average, 22\% short of population need according to nutrition recommendations (supply:need ratio: 0.78 [Range: 0.05–2.01]). This ratio varies widely by country income level, with a median supply:need ratio of 0.42 and 1.02 in low-income and highincome countries, respectively. A sensitivity analysis accounting for need-side food wastage showed similar insufficiency, to a slightly greater extent (global supply:need ratio: 0.66, varying from 0.37 [low-income countries] to 0.77 [high-income countries]). Using agricultural production and population projections, we also estimated supply and need for FV for 2025 and 2050. Assuming medium fertility and projected growth in agricultural production, the global supply:need ratio for FV increases slightly to 0.81 by 2025 and to 0.88 by 2050, with similar patterns seen across country income levels. In a sensitivity analysis assuming no change from current levels of FV production, the global supply:need ratio for FV decreases to 0.66 by 2025 and to 0.57 by 2050.
Conclusion: The global nutrition and agricultural communities need to find innovative ways to increase FV production and consumption to meet population health needs, particularly in low-income countries.},

Cognitive scientists Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach argue that we survive and thrive despite our mental shortcomings because we live in a rich community of knowledge. The key to our intelligence lies in the people and things around us. We're constantly drawing on information and expertise stored outside our heads: in our bodies, our environment, our possessions, and the community with which we interact--and usually we don't even realize we're doing it. 
The human mind is both brilliant and pathetic. We have mastered fire, created democratic institutions, stood on the moon, and sequenced our genome. And yet each of us is error prone, sometimes irrational, and often ignorant. The fundamentally communal nature of intelligence and knowledge explains why we often assume we know more than we really do, why political opinions and false beliefs are so hard to change, and why individually oriented approaches to education and management frequently fail. But our collaborative minds also enable us to do amazing things. This book contends that true genius can be found in the ways we create intelligence using the world around us.},

To test whether this approach presents a viable alternative to horizontal crop production systems, a VFS (where plants were grown in upright cylindrical columns) was compared against a conventional horizontal hydroponic system (HHS) using lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. “Little Gem”) as a model crop. Both systems had similar root zone volume and planting density. Half-s­trength Hoagland’s solution was applied to plants grown in perlite in an indoor controlled environment room, with metal halide lamps providing artificial lighting. Light distribution (photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) and yield (shoot fresh weight) within each system were assessed. Although PPFD and shoot fresh weight decreased significantly in the VFS from top to base, the VFS produced more crop per unit of growing floor area when compared with the HHS. Our results clearly demonstrate that VFS presents an attractive alternative to horizontal hydroponic growth systems and suggest that further increases in yield could be achieved by incorporating artificial lighting in the VFS.},

Evaluation and development of alternative market outlets is one means of helping small farms to become more economically sustainable. From 2000 to 2020 the US population is expected to increase by between 50 and 80 million people. A concomitant increase in consumer demand for local, fresh, specialty and organic produce is also projected. Alternative market outlets that skillfully link local or regional small-scale production with evolving consumer demand are currently lacking. We hypothesize that there is considerable potential for helping small farmers sustain or improve their economic position and fulfill consumer needs by exploiting these connections in the marketplace. This investigation draws from the literature to ascertain whether horticultural auction markets may provide such a link for small farms. The paper characterizes horticultural auction markets using current and historical examples, discusses marketplace changes with special reference to consumer demand, and appraises the value of this market model with respect to the dual challenge of meeting both farmers’ and consumers’ needs. Current marketplace research and characteristics suggest measured optimism for horticultural auction markets to provide a small farm–consumer link.},

  abstract = {Many decisions are based on beliefs
concerning the likelihood of uncertain
events such as the outcome of an election,
the guilt of a defendant, or the
future value of the dollar. These beliefs
are usually expressed in statements such
as "I think that . . . ," "chances are
. . . ," "it is unlikely that . . . ," and
so forth. Occasionally, beliefs concerning
uncertain events are expressed in
numerical form as odds or subjective
probabilities. What determines such beliefs?
How do people assess the probability
of an uncertain event or the
value of an uncertain quantity? This
article shows that people rely on a
limited number of heuristic principles
which reduce the complex tasks of assessing
probabilities and predicting values
to simpler judgmental operations.
In general, these heuristics are quite
useful, but sometimes they lead to severe
and systematic errors.
The subjective assessment of probability
resembles the subjective assessment
of physical quantities such as
distance or size. These judgments are
all based on data of limited validity,
which are processed according to heuristic
rules. For example, the apparent
distance of an object is determined in
part by its clarity. The more sharply the
object is seen, the closer it appears to
be. This rule has some validity, -because
in any given scene the more distant
objects are seen less sharply than nearer
objects. However, the reliance on this
rule leads to systematic errors in the
estimation of distance. Specifically, distances
are often overestimated when
visibility is poor because the contours
of objects are blurred. On the other
hand, distances are often underesti-

mated when visibility is good because
the objects are seen sharply. Thus, the
reliance on clarity as an indication of
distance leads to common biases. Such
biases are also found in the intuitive
judgment of probability. This article
describes three heuristics that are employed
to assess probabilities and to
predict values. Biases to which these
heuristics lead are enumerated, and the
applied and theoretical implications of
these observations are discussed.},

Our focus has been on the development of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to provide growers with real-time information about soil/substrate water content and environmental conditions to facilitate resource management. The graphical user interface (GUI) can be used to configure automated irrigation, based on soil/substrate water content thresholds. Testing the WSNs in commercial production settings has shown multiple benefits of this technology: 40-70\% reduction in water use, faster growth of some crops, decreased problems with root pathogens, and increased profits. We have also shown that precision control over substrate water content can be used as an alternative to plant growth retardants in ornamental production, by simply lowering the substrate water content when plant height increases faster than desired. The technology benefits society-at-large as well, because it fosters decreases in non-point source pollution by agro-chemicals. Based on the economic benefits and the expected price for these WSNs, we expect rapid industry adoption of this technology.},

  abstract = {Political targets for consumption of organic food are set in many European countries and also in Norway. Organic food is in these policies often considered as a spearhead for transition towards more sustainable production and consumption in the food sector. Measures such as consumer information and food labelling schemes are established in order to increase consumption of organic food. These policies are in line with a view within the academic discourse were the reflexive, political consumer is seen as a key agent for change. However, in spite of a major political effort to increase organic food consumption in Norway over the past 15 years, consumption has increased marginally. We therefore question this view of the consumer's influence and power to change the relations in e and developments of e the present food system. Based on the results of two consumer surveys carried out in 2000 and 2013, the article discusses the observed changes in perceptions of barriers towards purchase of organic food among Norwegian consumers. We found that organic food was considered more available in the stores in 2013 than in 2000. However, for other factors such as trust in the labelling system and the quality of organic food the perceptions had become more negative. Most important; more consumers saw no benefits from buying organic food in 2013 than in 2000. This means that the political emphasis on the self-regulating consumer has shown little effect. The article concludes that both the political tools and theoretical analyses to a greater extent must be turned away from a primary focus on the consumer towards identifying key economic and political conflicts of interest as important barriers to sustainable food consumption transition.},

We used the Stochastic Impact Evaluation (SIE) approach to guide the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) on viable investment options in honey value chains, which the agency considered implementing as an economic incentive for communities along the Kenya-Somalia border to conserve biodiversity. The SIE approach allows for holistic analysis of project cost, benefit, and risk variables, including those with uncertain and missing information. It also identifies areas that pose critical uncertainties in the project. We started by conducting a baseline survey in Witu and Awer in Lamu County, Kenya. The aim of the survey was to establish the current farm income from beekeeping as a baseline, against which the prospective impacts of intervention options could be measured. We then developed an intervention decision model that was populated with all cost, benefit and risk variables relevant to beekeeping. After receiving training in making quantitative estimates, four subject-matter experts expressed their uncertainty about the proposed variables in the model by specifying probability distributions for them. We then used Monte Carlo simulation to project decision outcomes. We also identified variables that projected decision outcomes were most sensitive to, and we determined the value of information for each variable. The variable with the highest information value to the decision-maker in Witu was the honey price. In Awer, no additional information on any of the variables would change the recommendation to invest in honey value chains in the region. The analysis demonstrates a novel and comprehensive approach to decision-making for different stakeholders in a project where decision outcomes are uncertain.},

  abstract = {It is often very difficult to make accurate projections about how interventions will affect the real
world and to use such projections to develop effective implementation plans, monitor progress and
evaluate project impacts. This is due to a variety of factors including lack of data, complex impact
pathways and risks and uncertainties that are difficult to factor into intervention planning. Scientific
approaches to produce reliable impact projections are rarely applied in agricultural development, but
Decision Analysis techniques commonly used in other fields have the potential to improve
development decisions. This working paper outlines a Decision Analysis approach that can help
decision makers efficiently allocate resources to enhance the effectiveness of policy decisions.
The procedures outlined in this publication feature the construction of causal models – models that
describe the mechanisms through which intervention impacts will be delivered – that are codeveloped
by experts, stakeholders and analysts through facilitated participatory processes. These
models are then formalized as Bayesian Network (BN) models, a modelling approach that has been
widely applied in a range of disciplines, including medical sciences, genetics, environmental sciences
and legal reasoning. BNs allow for the formal representation of causal models, such as intervention
impact pathways. They can work effectively with incomplete information, combine expert knowledge
with other sources of information and allow for adequate consideration of risk.
This paper illustrates the use of participatory workshops that convene experts on the systems,
stakeholders involved in ongoing or prospective projects and analysts. These teams can jointly
develop impact pathways for the interventions, which can be formalized into quantitative BN models.
After several rounds of feedback elicitation and the inclusion of data from experts and other sources,
stochastic simulations can be run to determine the likely impacts of the interventions. Results can be
presented back to stakeholders for feedback.
Through the tools presented in this working paper, critical uncertainties in the models of intervention
impact pathways can be identified. These high-value variables can determine uncertainty about
project outcomes. Further measurement or disaggregation of these variables can support decisionmaking
processes.
By demonstrating improved intervention decisions with little additional investment and improved
tools for intervention decision modelling, we hope that this approach will be widely adopted and used
to enhance the efficacy of development activities.},

We conclude that the development of Uganda's agricultural sector should consider the role that agrobiodiversity in the current small-scale agricultural systems plays in national food and nutrition security. Any changes according to Vision 2040 should also include farmers' voices and current crop management systems as guides for a sustainable food supply in the region.

However, the contribution of this agrobiodiversity to food and nutrition security has rarely been explored empirically. The present study sought to assess the influence of homegarden agrobiodiversity, production system parameters, and socio-economic factors on household dietary diversity and anthropometric conditions in southwest Uganda. Plant inventories of 102 homegardens were followed by two 24-hour recalls (n=589) and anthropometric measurements (n=325) of household members, as well as food insecurity questionnaires (n=95) for households. Regression models explained between 16 and 50\% of variance in dietary diversity and between 21 and 75\% in anthropometric measurements. Results indicate that supporting diverse homegarden systems can be part of the solution to food insecurity in Uganda. Recommendations are made for further strengthening the role of homegardens towards improving dietary and anthropometric outcomes.},

Additionally, these farmers seek to maximise profit within the context of farm and family objectives by focusing upon cost control, attention to detail, product quality and achieving high yields whilst primarily focusing upon enterprise margins; succession planning played an important role in decision making on some farms. Farmer decision making represents the outcome of responses to complex inter-linked issues; policy makers face the challenge of understanding this complexity and delivering policies that will generate multi-output objectives.},

  abstract = {Expert judgement plays an important role in forecasting and elsewhere, as it can be used to quantify models when no data are available and to improve predictions from models when combined with data. In order to provide defensible estimates of unknowns in an analysis, the judgements of multiple experts can be elicited. Mathematical aggregation methods can then be used to combine these individual judgements into a single judgement for the decision maker. However, most mathematical aggregation methods assume that such judgements come from experts who are independent, which is unlikely to be the case in practice. This paper investigates dependence in expert judgement studies, both within and between experts. It provides the most comprehensive analysis to date by considering all studies in the TU Delft database. It then assesses the practical significance of the dependencies identified in the studies by comparing the performances of several mathematical aggregation methods with varying dependence assumptions. Between-expert correlations were more prevalent than within-expert correlations. For studies that contained between-expert correlations, models which include these produced better forecasts. The implications of this for the use of expert judgement in forecasting are discussed.},

Maximum mycorrhizal infection (80.5\%+3.11) occurred at the second most polluted site (2.36 kg N ha-\textasciitilde{} year-1), and thereafter there was a significant decrease in mycorrhizal infection rate along the pollution gradient, down to 14.5\% -I- 2.64 at the most polluted site.

In a second greenhouse experiment, Calluna moorland peat microcosms from a single site (thus eliminating residual soil effects as a variable) were subjected over 12 months to NH\textasciitilde{}- (as ammonium sulphate) and NO\textasciitilde{}- (as nitric acid) concentrations which were one, two and six times the ambient values of 12kgNha -\textasciitilde{} year -\textasciitilde.

  abstract = {Successful implementation of major projects requires careful management of uncertainty and risk. Yet such uncertainty is rarely effectively calculated when analysing project costs and benefits. This paper presents a Bayesian Network (BN) modelling framework to calculate the costs, benefits, and return on investment of a project over a specified time period, allowing for changing circumstances and trade-offs. The framework uses hybrid and dynamic BNs containing both discrete and continuous variables over multiple time stages. The BN framework calculates costs and benefits based on multiple causal factors including the effects of individual risk factors, budget deficits, and time value discounting, taking account of the parameter uncertainty of all continuous variables. The framework can serve as the basis for various project management assessments and is illustrated using a case study of an agricultural development project.},

  abstract = {While vertical farming can promote sustainable living and mitigate urban heat island, vegetation
could worsen the cross natural ventilation due to additional drag force on air flow. This study aims to
investigate the impact of vertical farming on ventilation performance that is important to the thermal
comfort especially at tropical/subtropical cities. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation
was first validated against the wind tunnel experiment in the street canyon with tree planting. The
vegetable was modelled as porous medium in CFD simulation. In the parametric study, six facades
designs were investigated with respect to vegetable block ratios, arrangement, and vegetable species. The
results indicate that the natural ventilation performance is highly affected by the block ratio of vegetable.
When three forth of the façade is covered by vegetable, i.e. block ratio of 0.75, the ventilation of the
façade is very limited. For the façade with a block ratio of 0.5, half of incoming air flow can reach the
near field downstream of the façade to promote indoor thermal comfort. Therefore, in the design process
of the vertical farming, the block ratio of vegetable should be carefully determined regarding the
ventilation performance. Furthermore, the natural ventilation with the same block ratio of vegetable could
also be improved by appropriately modifying vegetable arrangement and vegetable species. This study
provides important understandings on vertical farming to enable architects to make the evidence-based
decision in the architectural design.},

  abstract = {Organically and locally grown food products have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, unlike food products, consumers purchase most outdoor plants for their aesthetic value rather than their nutritional value. Many of the health concerns related to food products might not be applicable to ornamental plants, so the demand for organic non-food plants is unknown. Using a survey with 834 participants from four states, we investigated consumer preference for ornamentals, vegetable transplants, and herbs grown: 1) organically, locally, and sustainably; 2) in energy-efficient greenhouses; and 3) in biodegradable, compostable, and recyclable containers. Our study found that consumers are not enthusiastic about plants or their fertilizers being ‘‘organic.’’ However, consumers are very interested in plants being produced locally, similar to the public’s everincreasing interest in local food products. Consumers are also interested in purchasing plants in containers that are more sustainable. Among the different types of containers, biodegradable and compostable pots are more desirable than recycled pots.},

  abstract = {The issue of food security has affected the well-being of the people for centuries. Academic and industry experts have been constantly developing alternate and better ways to address this issue. One of such innovations is the concept of vertical and zero acreage farming for providing food security and ensuring environmental sustainability. However, this concept has been in its nascent stage, and its development has been sporadic for many years. This paper uses a comprehensive framework to conduct a feasibility analysis of initiating vertical farming on university campuses, which could set an example for using this technique on a large scale. A case study was conducted on a set of 24 canteens across a university in Wuhan, China for accessing the return on investment and food sufficiency using this technique. By using the central limit theorem, a model was developed after investing in 24 canteens in the university, and various scenarios were analyzed. The breakeven on implementing these farms was about 10 to 20 years, with annual profits reaching \$92,000 (592,000 RMB).},
